- Paper 2 - Hippokratia - Long-term outcome after implantation of prosthetic disc nucleus device (PDN) in lumbar disc disease


Paper 1 - 

In the first paper looked at, the researchers looked assessing the clinical efficacy of the prosthetic disc nucleus (PDN) for 
 treatment of lumbar disc herniation. I looked at what implications there were between implantation of the PDN at the Lumbar 4 - Lumbar 5 area compared to the Lumbar 5 - Sciatic 1 area. However, i realised there were many limitations with this paper, and so the analysis was mostly just practicing what i would do for the data in the second paper. 

 Paper 2 - 

 In the second paper, they research into the long-term outcome after implantation of prosthetic disc nucleus device (PDN) in lumbar disc disease. When reading through the paper I came across the table below, I saw that intuitively that it looked like after the implantation of the PDN, the range of motion (ROM) decreased whilst the change in height after implantation increased. I became curious to see if these two variables did in fact impact one another.

The analysis of the Hippokratia paper can be found in the repository under the name, ' Data_from_Hippokratia.ipynb', However there were also limitations with this paper as it lacked the required data to tell if there was a significant difference. 

A second notebook was created for this paper, which is found under the name, ' simulated_data_for_Hippokratia.ipynb', this simulated the data by taking the means of each data point adding or subtracting the standard deviation and then simulating 100 data points.
